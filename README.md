# Sketch Image Clustering based on Semantic Similarity

 - Worked on Tu Berlin Sketch dataset consisting of 20,000 sketch images belonging to 250 categories
 
 - Implemented Transfer Learning using fastai with ResNet34 as base architecture to achieve an accuracy of 78.90% on test dataset of 4000 sketch images outperforming the human accuracy of 73.10%
 
 - Clustered images based on semantic similarities by first converting predictions to high dimensional
vectors using spacyâ€™s english corpus and then using pairwise cosine similarity of the vectors

## Example Clusters: 

* **Cluster 1**
